IMPORTANT NOTES BEFORE INSTALLATION

The Python version required to run Reboot has to be 3.6 or earlier, 3.7 will not work.
Reboot can only run on Windows right now due to the modules being used.

PYTHON MODULES REQUIRED TO RUN REBOOT

You need the following modules:
PyAudio
Pywin32
Requests
SpeechRecognition

These can be installed by going into Command Prompt and typing 'pip install' and module required.

RUNNING CONFIG.PY

Before starting Reboot, run the configuration file. This takes in your name, city, email address and password. For your location, type in the city's full name, and as a warning, some cities may not be supported by the weather feature.
To see what cities are supported, consult OpenWeatherAPI.

Before you can use your email to send messages, you will need to disable security features on your address. While Reboot is safe and will not harm it, I suggest using a throwaway email address, as it won't
matter that much if your account is compromised.

FINAL NOTE
Reboot needs new features, so if you want to, feel free to make some!
Go wild:)
